                  <h3>V&A Museum of Childhood Bear Promo</h3>
                  <p>V&A approached our university with a request to create a video for their events. My pitch was chosen and my animation was featured on the museum's social media platforms. The video was intended to be used on Instagram, hence the dimentions. Music was designed by Gonzalo R. Checa (www.grch.es @glux_) <a>to see more about this project click here</a></p>
